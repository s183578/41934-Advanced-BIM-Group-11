## Summary of the use case
According to BIM UseCase Booklet this tool is based on the Use Case 'Energy Analysis' with a forecast usage in the design phase. 
The goal of the tool is to contribute with an estimate of the ventilation demand in every zone of an building. This will help the building designer by automateing the calculations and to implement it early in the design phase. 

## The tool
The tool can be used by both architects and engineers (building designers) who takes part in any design phase of a building project.

## Business and societal value
The intention of the project is to develop a tool for the early design stages. It is a big advantage to know as much as possible in the early phases, which is why the user can benefit of knowing about spaces and requirement of the ventilation system so it can be implemented and taken into account. It will greatly save time in the longer run to know an estimate of ventilation ducts, shafts and the AHU. Hopefully it will prevent too tight spaces for ducts, shafts etc.

The tool can lead to fewer urgent incidents and better space allocation, where money can be spent in other focus areas. Hopefully it can lead to better HVAC solutions that will reduce the energy usage and maintenance need, resulting in more sustainable solutions. And optimized space management which results in an overall better building.

## Requirements for the the tool

###  Software and packages
An array of software and packages are needed in order to run the code. Most of it has been documented inside of the code, but here is a recap.
1. Python 3.7
2. ifcopenshell version
3. ifcopenshell.geom
4. xlsxwriter
5. os
6. numpy

### Files needed
The files needed for the project are all included inside of the repository. Just download it in its entirety and follow the steps in the guide section below.
1. Python code: "main.py"
2. Model file: "Duplex_A_20110907.ifc"
3. Empty folder called "output" in which the excel sheet will be written to



### Guide

## Furture work
The tool is still very unoptimized and a lot of futures we wanted to include in the tool was out of the time scope.
