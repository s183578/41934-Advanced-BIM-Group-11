### Process of developing the tool
* Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
* Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
* Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we haev more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?

The process of the course can definitely support the progress in future BIM-related work. Wherever the case is to develope smarter tools for BIM use or working with BIM models in general.
The freedom and independence in forming our own use case lead to a better result in order to approach our own interests. It was a really good idea to have some framework though as the process sometimes seemed a little unclear. In general: The freedom is nice, but it definitely helps with some sort of guidience to get in the right direction and develope a tool that fulfills and applies with both the aim and the goal. 



### Output of the tool
* did the tool address the use case you identified?
* was the use case well modelled
* was the project clearly scoped

The tool is able to quantify ventilation demands in any zones of a BIM-model. This applies with the use case which was well defined and clear in what the project aimed for. 


### Future

* Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis
* Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?

Without a doubt OpenBIM has entered the scene of information tools that can provide and improve information exhange between certain stakeholders. The building industry should implement OpenBIM in their daily work so we can work smarter and build better and cheaper buildings in the future. Even though it was interesting to work with OpenBIM in this course it is unlikely that it will be a part of our theses.
