# A5: Project Reflection - Group 22

### Process of developing the tool
- Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?

- Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?

- Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we haev more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?

The amount of tools that was introduced were okay but

The process of the course can definitely support the progress in future BIM-related work. Wherever the case is to develope smarter tools for BIM use or working with BIM models in general.
The freedom and independence in forming our own use case lead to a better result in order to approach our own interests. It was a really good idea to have some framework though as the process sometimes seemed a little unclear. In general: The freedom is nice, but it definitely helps with some sort of guidience to get in the right direction and develope a tool that fulfills and applies with both the aim and the goal. 



### Output of the tool
- Did the tool address the use case you identified?

The tool we developed throughout the course were able to address the use case in a terms of being able to quantify simple ventilation demands in any zones of a IFC BIM model according to DS/EN 16798. However all of the features that we wanted to implement were perhaps a bit out of our coding capabilites and time scope to be able to be implemented. We used a lot of time to gather the solar radiation coming in through the windows due to complex math inside of a coding language we weren't familiar with. 


- Was the use case well modelled

The neat thing about our use case of ventilation rates is that a lot of parameters can keep on being added to make a more complete calculation. This would allow us to almost never stop working on the tool, but also stop whenever we feel that its suffiecient enough.  


- Was the project clearly scoped

The project was clearly scoped in a way that would allow us to continue on working on the tool as we could keep piling on parameters such as heat gains, cooling, heating and much more. However the intial scope was just to create a fast and easy overview of ventilation rates in different parts of a building and that goal was achieved. 



### Future

- Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis



- Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?




Without a doubt OpenBIM has entered the scene of information tools that can provide and improve information exhange between certain stakeholders. The building industry should implement OpenBIM in their daily work so we can work smarter and build better and cheaper buildings in the future. Even though it was interesting to work with OpenBIM in this course it is unlikely that it will be a part of our theses.
