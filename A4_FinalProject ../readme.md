## A4 Final Projekt
William Nielsen - Sebastian Krogh Nielsen - Samuel Daniel Leinum - Patrick Dahlgreen Petersen

#### Summary of the use case / why is this a challenge?
According to BIM UseCase Booklet this tool is based on the Use Case 'Energy Analysis' with a forecast usage in the design phase. 
The goal of the tool is to contribute with an estimate of the ventilation demand in every zone of an building. This will help the building designer by automateing the calculations and to implement it early in the design phase.



#### Who is your tool for?
The tool can be used by both architects and engineers (building designers) who takes part in any design phase of a building project.


#### Business and societal value
It brings a massive increase in value to any business that would use this. The intention of the project is to develop a tool for the early design stages. It's a very big advantance to know as much as possible in the early phases so it can be implemented and taking into account in every relevant design proces. It will greatly save time in the longer run that the ventilation shafts and AHU already have an easy and rough estimate and can hopefully prevent too tight spaces for ducts, shafts etc.

It would save a lot of money, that could be used to plant trees. Hopefully it can lead to better HVAC solutions that would reduce the energy usage and maintenance, resulting in more sustainable solutions. And optimized space management which results in an overall better building.
