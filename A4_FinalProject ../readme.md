#### Summary of the use case / why is this a challenge?
According to BIM UseCase Booklet this tool is based on the Use Case 'Energy Analysis' with a forecast usage in the design phase. 
The goal of the tool is to contribute with an estimate of the ventilation demand in every zone of an building. This will help the building designer by automateing the calculations and to implement it early in the design phase.



#### Who is your tool for?
The tool can be used by both architects and engineers (building designers) who takes part in any design phase of a building project.


#### Business and societal value
The intention of the project is to develop a tool for the early design stages. It is a big advantage to know as much as possible in the early phases, which is why the user can benefit of knowing about spaces and requirement of the ventilation system so it can be implemented and taken into account. It will greatly save time in the longer run to know an estimate of ventilation ducts, shafts and the AHU. Hopefully it will prevent too tight spaces for ducts, shafts etc.

The tool can lead to fewer urgent incidents and better space allocation, where money can be spent in other focus areas. Hopefully it can lead to better HVAC solutions that will reduce the energy usage and maintenance need, resulting in more sustainable solutions. And optimized space management which results in an overall better building.


#### Demo of the tool (if interaction / processing takes longer â€“ edit the video ðŸ˜Š)




## Outline of the video

Boss: Patrick 
Co-worker 1: Samuel
Co-worker 2: William
Mesiah: Sebastian

Scene 1: 
  DTU IntroVideo.

Scene 2:
  Set: Small meeting room, boss in standing at end of table. Coworkers are sitting with laptops open looking at boss talking.
  
  Dialog: Boss: "Guys, (Start walking back and foward) we have just gotten a new case we need done by the end of the day. We need to calculate the ventiliation rates      in every office of a highrise!!!!!!!!"

Scene 3:
  Camera cuts to co-worker 2 frantically typing and looking stressed at the computer. "BUT SIR THAT WOULD TAKE DAYS TO COMPLETE, WE CAN'T MAKE IT!"
  
Scene 4:
  Camera cuts to boss looking sad and distressed: "Oh no, what are we gonna do!"
  
Scene 5:
  The door get SLAMMED up and Mesiah steps in. "Don't worry guys, I get the solution to your problem right here."
  
Scene 6:
  Cuts to the boss. "Really?! how does it work?"
  
Scene 7:
  Mesiah stands in the doorway with an open computer. "I'll show you" while nodding his head and smilling. Camera pans into the computer screen.
  

Screen recording of us using the program with the building and showing the results.
  "First load the building into the script, and then navigate to the result tab, and then the ventilation rates will be shown on the right side of the screen".........
  
  
Scene 8: Camera cuts to the two co-workers and the boss with their jaws open looking flabbergasted and amazed of the script.

The end
